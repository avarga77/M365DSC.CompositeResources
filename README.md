# M365DSC.CompositeResources

This module contains various Composite Resources for Microsoft365DSC, which can be used with Microsoft365DSC deployments. Each workload has its own Composite Resource.
The module is generated based on a specific version of Microsoft365DSC and has to be used in combination with that version.

These Composite Resources are also used in the Microsoft365DSC whitepaper ["Managing Microsoft 365 in true DevOps style with Microsoft365DSC and Azure DevOps"](https://aka.ms/m365dscwhitepaper).
